An update or upgrade does not give the user any additional or extended rights of use to the licensed software. 

9.3	If Maxon provides the user with an update to ensure the contractual use of the software or to remove a defect, the user must install the update to continue to use the software in accordance with the contract.

10.1	If the user violates this license agreement, uses the software without the required rights of use or otherwise violates Maxon's intellectual property rights, the right of use granted in this license agreement shall immediately become invalid and Maxon may terminate this license agreement without notice. The user must then cease all use of the software immediately and completely and delete or destroy all copies. Maxon’s other rights, claims and measures against the user remain reserved.

10.2	The software contains technical protective functions against unauthorized use and for the administration of rights. The protective functions prevent the user from using the software in a way, for a purpose or to an extent that does not correspond to the respective license model and violates this license agreement.

This data is transmitted to Maxon via a communication interface of the Software via network connections and the Internet. Maxon processes the data to fulfill this license agreement and to protect the software from unauthorized use. The user may not remove or circumvent the protective functions and may not use the software without the protective functions. Deactivating the "Send information to Maxon" function in the software does not deactivate the protection functions.

11.1	Maxon provides the software to the user free from defects of quality and title.

11.2	Maxon is not obliged to remedy defects of quality or title caused by (1) the use of the software contrary to the provisions of this License Agreement, (2) the use of the software in systems or together with hardware and software that are unsuitable for this purpose and have not been released by Maxon, or (3) the use of the software by the user unless the user can prove that the defect was not caused thereby.

12.2	Maxon's liability for slightly negligent violations of cardinal obligations is limited to direct damages, which are typical for this license agreement and were foreseeable at execution of the contract. Primary obligations are obligations on the part of Maxon which enable the fulfillment of this license agreement, i.e., which are prerequisites for the execution of this agreement and on which the user must be able to rely. In case of slight negligence Maxon is not liable for lost profit on the part of the user.

12.3	Otherwise Maxon's liability is excluded.

13.2	If the software has the function "Send information to Maxon", the user can activate and deactivate this function while using the software. Activating this function causes the software to automatically send software and hardware information to Maxon from time to time via the existing network connection. This information includes, but is not limited to, the version and area and language settings of the software, system information about the hardware and data about the use, configuration and problems encountered with the software. The contents and files created and processed by the user as well as personal data (name or address) are not sent to Maxon with this function. Maxon processes and uses the information sent for statistical purposes and to improve its products and services and will only pass it on to third parties or use it for other purposes with the user's consent. Maxon does not link the information sent to personal data and does not use it to identify the user or create user profiles.
