# VR SURGERY
Surgery robots are fascinating but they are expensive! As a result the technology remains limited to a handful of people. "Surgery Robot Simulator" aims to solve this issue by replicating the experience of using a surgery robot (modeled based off the DaVinci System). The program's goal is to ultimately expose the user to basic controls of surgery robots such as grabbing, cutting, and suturing. A point system is in place to help the user perform a certain task with a high amount of percision, like placing a box into a container accurately.
The purpose of this program is to not only make the experience of using surgery robots more accessible, but also to train surgeons on a wider scale, to help hospitals see if surgical robots are worth investing in, share the experience of using advanced medical technology with the world, and could be used in to teach highschool students as well.
